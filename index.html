      <h3>Jerry the cat loves his string ball!</h3>
      <img src="string.jpg" alt="Cat with ball of string.">
      <p>I can't get over how adorable Jerry is when he plays with his string ball! He gets all tangled up in it. I feel sad for him sometimes when he can't escape his self-imposed prison.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I watch Snowball sleep for hours. I can't get over what an angel she is! I forgot to eat the other day I was so overcome with emotion.</p>
